<PRE>Robert makes an excellent point.  For datasets that fit in memory,  
caching objects and slot values in memory makes the use of lisp as a  
query language really easy.

Another (unreleased) prevalence-like facility in Elephant:

In src/contrib/eslick/snapshot-set.lisp is a simple object caching  
model that works for non-persistent object.  It allows you to register  
objects with a special hash as 'root' objects.  This hash can be saved  
and restored and it stores the root objects and all objects  
'reachable' from the root set.  The notion of reachable can be  
overloaded but now it's defined recursively for any standard object or  
hash in a slot of a reachable object.  The whole snapshot-set concept  
is about 300 lines of code, so pretty easy to read as an example.

A potential proposal:

It's also fairly easy to add a special cached-persistent-slot which  
caches its values and implements a write-through policy.  This allows  
you to keep all your slot-accesses in memory (making object-based  
search very efficient) but still exploit on-disk BTrees for indexing  
when you need to.

You'd have to think through the implications of this strategy,  
though.  It works great if your data is read-only or only operated on  
in one thread.  If you can handle some in-coherence (the slot value  
can be changed at any time) in your read-oriented algorithms then you  
can ignore threading issues.

(Hmmmm...one hack might be to force a database read of cached slots  
when you are in a transaction so you can guarantee that any writes to  
that page in a parallel transaction result in a restart.  If you are  
just doing auto-commit, the read is to the cached value).
