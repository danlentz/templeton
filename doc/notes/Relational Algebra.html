  Operands of this algebra are relations.

  <H3>Set Operations on Relations</H3>
  
  <P>
  For the set operations on relations,
  both operands must have the same scheme, and the result has that same scheme.
  <UL>
  <LI> R1 U R2 (union)
  is the relation containing all tuples that appear in R1, R2, or both.
  <P>
  <LI> R1 n R2 (intersection)
  is the relation containing all tuples that appear in both R1 and R2.
  <P>
  <LI> R1 - R2 (set difference)
  is the relation containing all tuples of R1 that do not appear in R2.
  </UL>
  
  <HR>
  <H3>Selection</H3>
  <P>
  Selects tuples from a relation
  whose attributes meet the selection criteria,
  which is normally expressed as a predicate.
  <PRE>
  <B>

  <P>
  That is, from R1 we create a new relation R2 containing
  those tuples from R1 that satisfy (make true) the predicate P.
  
  <P>
  A <em>predicate</em> is a boolean expression whose operators are
  the logical connectives (and, or, not)
  and arithmetic comparisons (LT, LE, GT, GE, EQ, NE),
  and whose operands are either domain names or domain constants.

  Given a domain from each relation, <em>join</em>

  If the two relations being joined have exactly one attribute (domain)
  name in common, then we assume that the single attribute in common

  the result.
